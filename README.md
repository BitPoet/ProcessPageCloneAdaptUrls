# ProcessPageCloneAdaptUrls
ProcessWire module that adapts links and img sources in CKEditor fields when cloning a page so the links point to the assets directory of the copy instead of the original.

By default, ProcessWire doesn't touch content in HTML fields (textareas) when cloning a page.

## Usage
